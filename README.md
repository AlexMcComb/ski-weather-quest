## SkiQuest Weather App

Weather driven app allows users to discover new ski locations and search a city or click on a ski resort icon to determine if it's a good day to go skiing based on weather conditions.  A map allows the user to visualize current temperature and precipitation levels to see how large a storm is and the amount of snowfall.  

A ski area layer was also added as a geoJSON to allow the user to discover new ski areas.
